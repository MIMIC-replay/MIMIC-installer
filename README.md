Here is the source code for our installation package, which sets up and injects MIMIC's session replay recording functionality into your own application.
You can download the [package](https://pypi.org/project/mimic-replay/) with the following command:
```terminal
pip install mimic-replay
```
In the root folder of your application, run the installer with the command:
```terminal
python3 -m mimic_replay.install
```

**Please note that the installer will not work unless your MIMIC pipeline is running.** For more information, see our [installation guide](https://github.com/MIMIC-replay/MIMIC/blob/main/README.md)
